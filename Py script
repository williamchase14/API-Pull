#This script merges several big CSV's
#There's 2 sets of CSV's


# script 1 - merges the Race/sex files
# the files are on my desktop but can be accessed here: "https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/college-university/ipeds/fall-enrollment/2015/undergraduate/race/sex/"
import pandas as pd
import glob

# Path to your CSV files
csv_files = glob.glob(r'C:\Users\willi\Desktop\Age CSV files\*.csv')

# Create an empty DataFrame to hold all combined data
combined_data = pd.DataFrame()

# Loop through each file, read it, and append it to the combined DataFrame
for file in csv_files:
    data = pd.read_csv(file)
    combined_data = pd.concat([combined_data, data], ignore_index=True)

# Save the combined data to a new CSV file
# the files are on my desktop 
combined_data.to_csv(r'C:\Users\willi\Desktop\combined_summary.csv', index=False)

print("The combined data has been saved to 'combined_summary.csv'")


#Script 2 - merges the Age/sex files
#same thing as above but change the file path. Files can be found here: "https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/college-university/ipeds/fall-enrollment/2008/undergraduate/age/sex/"

The API is here: https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/colleges.html#ipeds-enrollment-fall-enrollment-by-level-of-study-full-time-part-time-status-race-and-sex

and here: https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/colleges.html#ipeds-enrollment-fall-enrollment-by-level-of-study-full-time-part-time-status-age-categories-and-sex

The API has no API Key, and will also limit API calls to 10,000 records. However, there are alot more than 10,000 records.
